- [x] Add support single file csv output (combine all df's from df_dict)

- [x] add loop delta analysis between events

- [ ] Add some optimizations to reduce loading time
    - maybe use python's csv module? pandas maybe an overkill

- [ ] perform ANOVA to observe change significance.

- [x] Optimize loop stats calculation

- [ ] Add support to filter by pid

- [x] add config file to support flexible pattern suppliment to the code

- [x] filter pattern at the time of grep'g and sed'g the raw data, to reduce load time in csv produced later

- [ ] Better use of reason part of `perf script` output to provide detailed statistics

- [ ] Implement submission, completion latencies from conf file pattern

- [ ] Separate all latencies in different files.

- [ ] Get visualizations

- [ ] Better UI
