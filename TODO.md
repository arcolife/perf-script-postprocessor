- [x] Add support single file csv output (combine all df's from df_dict)

- [ ] Add some optimizations to reduce loading time
    - maybe use python's csv module? pandas maybe an overkill

- [ ] Try to normalize the data so we could eliminate major points from a huge dataset

- [ ] maybe perform ANOVA to observe change significance.

- [ ] Optimize loop stats calculation
