{"name":"Perf-script-postprocessor","tagline":"Read perf.data (created by perf record) and process trace output to display delta","body":"# perf-script-postprocessor\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arcolife/perf-script-postprocessor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arcolife/perf-script-postprocessor)\r\n\r\nThis calculates delta (difference of timestamps from various\r\nentry/exit points from events recorded) from the trace output,\r\nwhich is produced by using the `perf script` command, which in turn,\r\nuses the perf.data file produced by using the `perf record` command,\r\na set of utilities,which is provided under the package [perf-tools](https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools)\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nStep 1: Install from pip: `$ pip2 install perf-script-postprocessor`\r\n\r\nStep 2: Copy [this conf file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcolife/perf-script-postprocessor/master/delta_processor.conf)\r\n     \tinto /etc/\r\n\r\nStep 3: Customize the conf file accordingly.\r\n\r\nOptional: \r\nStep 4: Refer to docs/WIKI.md or [this page](https://github.com/arcolife/perf-script-postprocessor/wiki) for detailed usage.\r\n\r\nFor more, refer to `INSTALL` guide. \r\n\r\n## TESTS\r\n\r\n`$ ./tests/run-tests.sh`\r\n\r\n## USAGE\r\n\r\n```$ perf_script_processor -p <dir path> -t <test type>```\r\n\r\nExample: ```$ perf_script_processor -p . -t 0```\r\n\r\n`-p` (defaults to `/tmp/pp_results`) is where one of the following exists:\r\n\r\n- perf.data -- binary file. If you're running this tool on perf.data, make sure\r\n\t\tyou're running it from the system where the binary was generated\r\n- raw_perf -- plain text output when `perf script` is run on folder containing perf.data\r\n- perf_data.csv -- generated in the process of generating results\r\n\r\n`-t` (defaults to `0`) is either `0` or `1`. It's the type of test that generated `perf.data`.\r\n\r\n- 0: Native\r\n- 1: Threads\r\n\r\nNOTE: The stats at the end of run, will be stored in `delta_output.log` in folder where you've generate the output.\r\n\r\n## FAQs and Script exection process\r\n\r\nRefer to docs/WIKI.md or [this page](https://github.com/arcolife/perf-script-postprocessor/wiki).\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nGPL V3\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
